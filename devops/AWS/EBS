 *you can increase volme size but you can't decrese it
 
 * you cannot encrypt a running instance
   way  1 - create a voluime you can encrypt 
   way 2 - create by snapshot

 *An EBS is volume is a network drive you can attach to yout instance while they run

 * it allows your instance to persist data even after their termination

 * they can only be mounted one instance at a time 

 * they bound a specific availablity zone
